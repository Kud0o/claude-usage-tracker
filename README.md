A tiny **zero-dependency** Claude Code hook that captures rich metadata about every
prompt — across all your concurrently-running workspaces — and a polished local
dashboard to slice through it.

```
 each Claude session ── Stop hook ── reads its transcript ──▶  one ndjson file per workspace
                                                                       │
                                            viewer (local web app) ◀───┘   filters · charts · drill-down
```

## Features

- **Per-prompt records** — prompt & response text, input/output/cache tokens, model,
  permission **mode**, configured **effort**, context-fill %, USD **cost**, duration,
  **first-response latency**, invoked **skills**, and tool/subagent/thinking counts.
- **You choose what's tracked, per project** — each project owns its config in its own
  `.claude-usage/` (inherited from a global defaults template, then independent). Toggle
  recording per project and pick which **field groups** are stored; disabled groups are
  stripped before writing (smaller files, more privacy). Manage it from that project's
  ⚙ settings or its config file.
- **Accurate accounting** — dedupes streamed transcript lines, attributes **subagent**
  token spend to the parent prompt, and prices each message at *its own* model.
- **Self-contained per project** — each project's `.claude-usage/` holds its data, a bundled viewer, and your saved view settings (`config.json`). Safe under concurrent sessions. Opt into a combined dashboard with one env var.
- **Insightful dashboard** — summary cards, inline-SVG charts (tokens over time, context-fill
  distribution, permission-mode and per-model splits), a filter bar, and click-to-expand drill-down.
- **Built for any team** — professional **light / dark** themes with a one-click toggle,
  **locale-aware** numbers and dates, and broad-script typography (IBM Plex). The drill-down
  **renders Markdown** — tables, code blocks, and lists from your prompts and responses display
  as formatted content (with a raw toggle), safely escaped.
- **Manage your own data** — delete the prompts currently shown (scoped by any filter) or a
  single record from the drill-down to reclaim disk space; the viewer rewrites the on-disk
  files in place and reports how much was freed.
- **Zero dependencies, zero build** — pure Node (`fs`/`http`) on the server, vanilla JS on the
  client. Nothing to `npm install`, nothing to compile.

## Quick start

One line — no clone, no config, no environment variables:

```sh
npx -y github:Kud0o/claude-usage-tracker
```

That registers the `Stop` hook for every workspace. Now just use Claude Code —
each project becomes **self-contained**: its data, its own copy of the viewer,
and your saved view settings all land in `<project>/.claude-usage/`. To look:

```sh
cd <your project>
node .claude-usage/viewer/server.mjs   # dashboard for this project → http://localhost:4317
```

To remove it: `npx -y github:Kud0o/claude-usage-tracker --uninstall`.

**Upgrading:** run the update command (or just re-run the one-liner):

```sh
npx -y github:Kud0o/claude-usage-tracker --update
```

It refreshes the shared app to the latest version, and each project re-bundles its own
viewer automatically on its next prompt (a version stamp detects the change), so existing
projects pick up the latest dashboard. Cloned repo? `git pull && node install.mjs --update`.

## Installation guide

### 1. Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 18** (already present — it ships with Claude Code).
- **Claude Code** desktop or CLI.

Check Node: `node --version`.

### 2. Install the hook

One line — nothing to clone, configure, or set as an environment variable:

```sh
npx -y github:Kud0o/claude-usage-tracker
```

Or, if you've cloned the repo:

```sh
node install.mjs              # global — every workspace   → ~/.claude/settings.json
node install.mjs --local      # this project only          → ./.claude/settings.local.json
```

The installer makes exactly two changes: it copies the app to
`~/.claude/usage-tracker/app/` and adds one `Stop` hook entry to your settings
(existing keys are preserved). No environment variables, no other config.

> Installing also enables tracking for your **current** session, so your next
> prompts are the first ones recorded.

### 3. View the dashboard

After a project's first prompt, it has its own viewer inside `.claude-usage/`.
Run it from the project:

```sh
cd <your project>
node .claude-usage/viewer/server.mjs            # → http://localhost:4317
```

Your filters, sort order, and grouping are saved per project in
`.claude-usage/config.json` (set `"port"` there to change the default port).
Add `.claude-usage/` to your project's `.gitignore` so the records don't get
committed.

### 4. Uninstall

```sh
node install.mjs --uninstall            # remove from both scopes
node install.mjs --uninstall --global   # remove from one scope
```

The app and recorded data are left in `~/.claude/usage-tracker/` — delete that folder
manually if you want them gone.

## The dashboard

- **Summary cards** — ordered by what matters for hands-on work: total tokens, prompts, average
  context, active time, top model, busiest workspace, and an estimated cost (de-emphasised, since
  most work isn't billed per API call).
- **Charts** — tokens over time, context-fill distribution, permission-mode split, prompts by model,
  skills invoked, and estimated cost / day (all inline SVG, theme-aware).
- **Filter bar** — workspace · model · mode · effort · date · free-text search · min-context %.
- **Table** — grouped by **workspace → session → prompt**, sortable on any column; a per-row badge
  flags how many **skills** a prompt invoked. Click a row to open a detail panel with the full
  prompt and response **rendered as Markdown** (tables, code, lists), the invoked skills as chips,
  plus a usage and cost breakdown.
- **Theme & locale** — light/dark toggle (defaults to your OS preference, remembered across visits);
  numbers, dates, and currency follow the viewer's browser locale.
- **Delete data** — a *delete shown* action removes exactly the records the current filters match
  (scope it by workspace, model, date, or search first), and each detail panel can delete that one
  prompt. Both ask for confirmation and report the space freed; deletions are permanent.

## Configuration

**Config is per project.** Each project owns its tracking + field choices inside its own
folder — the same file the viewer uses for title/port/ui:

```
<project>/.claude-usage/config.json
```

```jsonc
{
  "title": "MyApp", "port": 4317, "ui": { /* saved filters/sort/grouping */ },
  "tracking": { "enabled": true },   // record this project?
  "fields": {                        // which field groups to store for this project
    "text": true, "tokens": true, "cost": true, "context": true,
    "timing": true, "skills": true, "counts": true, "meta": true
  }
}
```

A **global defaults template** lives at `~/.claude/usage-tracker/config.json`
(`{ "enabledDefault": true, "fields": { … } }`). It is *only* a template:

- **Global install** → each project **inherits a copy** of the defaults into its own
  `config.json` the first time it's seen, then is independent. Tracking is **on by default**;
  disable or tune a project from *its own* dashboard without affecting others.
- **Local install** (`node install.mjs --local`) → the project's `config.json` is written at
  install time (tracked, defaults applied) — fully self-contained, no reliance on the global file.
- **Aggregate mode** (`CLAUDE_USAGE_DIR`) is the one exception: with everything pooled in one
  folder there's no per-project file, so the global defaults govern directly.

- **Field groups** — `text` (prompt/response), `tokens`, `cost`, `context`, `timing`
  (duration + first-response latency), `skills`, `counts`, `meta` (git branch, cli version,
  slug, tier, effort). A disabled group is **stripped before writing**; already-stored data
  is left as-is. `text` off keeps the character counts but drops the text itself.
- **Two ways to manage it:** the dashboard's **⚙ settings** panel — which edits **only the
  project you're viewing** (record toggle + field groups) — or by editing that project's
  `config.json` directly. The global template is edited by hand for changing future defaults.

The viewer **adapts** to your choices: cards, charts, table columns, drawer rows and filters
for a disabled (or simply absent) field group don't render.

## How it works

Claude Code already writes a full JSONL transcript per session. The `Stop` hook fires
after each response; [`src/record.mjs`](src/record.mjs) re-derives that session's prompts
from the transcript and upserts them into a shared per-workspace file. No interception,
no instrumentation, no database.

Three details make the numbers trustworthy (all in [`src/lib/transcript.mjs`](src/lib/transcript.mjs)):

| Reality of the transcript | Handling |
|---|---|
| One assistant message spans many streamed lines sharing `message.id` | Dedupe by id; keep the final usage |
| Subagents live in separate `…/<session>/subagents/*.jsonl` files | Attribute to the parent prompt via `promptId` |
| Subagents may run a cheaper model | Price each message at its own model |

## Where the data lives

Everything for a project lives **inside that project**, self-contained:

```
<project>/.claude-usage/
├── usage.ndjson     one JSON record per prompt (many sessions)
├── config.json      the viewer's saved settings (title, port, filters, sort, grouping)
└── viewer/          a copy of the dashboard — run it in place
```

The data never touches `~/.claude`, and the viewer that ships with each project reads its
own sibling folder. (The hook itself lives once at `~/.claude/usage-tracker/app/`; only the
recorded data + viewer copy are per-project.)

**Combined dashboard (optional):** set `CLAUDE_USAGE_DIR` to a shared folder for both the
hook and the viewer, and every project is collected there as `<encoded-cwd>.ndjson` — one
dashboard across all your workspaces (no per-project bundle in this mode).

**Concurrency:** two sessions in the *same* project use a lock-guarded atomic write
(`tmp`+rename, stale-lock stealing, skip-on-timeout). Each `Stop` re-derives the whole
session, so a skipped write self-heals on the next prompt.

## Notes & caveats

- **effort** isn't in the transcript — it's read best-effort from `settings.json`
  (`effortLevel`) at capture time, so it reflects the configured level.
- **Pricing** is cached in [`src/lib/pricing.mjs`](src/lib/pricing.mjs); update it if rates change.
- **context fill %** = the last request's `input + cache_read + cache_creation` over the
  model's context window.
- **first-response latency** is the gap from the prompt to the first streamed line of the
  first assistant message — a transcript-granularity approximation of time-to-first-token.
- **Disabling a field group affects new records only** — it does not scrub text or fields
  already written. Use *delete shown* to remove old records you don't want.

## Project layout

```
src/record.mjs          the Stop hook (entry point; opt-in gate + field stripping)
src/lib/transcript.mjs  parse JSONL → per-prompt turns (+ subagent attribution)
src/lib/config.mjs      global tracking/field config (self-contained; copied into the bundle)
src/lib/pricing.mjs     model → context window + USD pricing
src/lib/store.mjs       lock-guarded atomic per-workspace upsert
src/lib/paths.mjs       data dir / settings / cwd-encoding helpers
viewer/server.mjs       zero-dep HTTP API (list · detail · config · settings · delete) + static host
viewer/public/          the dashboard SPA
install.mjs             installer (--global | --local | --update | --uninstall)
```
